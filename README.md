# â€‹ðŸŒ³â€‹ðŸ’»Binary Trees
## Learning Objectives
------------
At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:

### General
- What is a binary tree
- What is the difference between a binary tree and a Binary Search Tree
- What is the possible gain in terms of time complexity compared to linked lists
- What are the depth, the height, the size of a binary tree
- What are the different traversal methods to go through a binary tree
- What is a complete, a full, a perfect, a balanced binary tree

## Requirements
------------
### General

- Allowed editors: `vi`, `vim`, `emacs`
- All your files will be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using gcc, using the options `-Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89`
- All your files should end with a new line
- A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
- Your code should use the Betty style. It will be checked using `betty-style.pl` and `betty-doc.pl`
- You are not allowed to use global variables
- No more than 5 functions per file
- You are allowed to use the standard library
- In the following examples, the `main.c` files are shown as examples. You can use them to test your functions, but you donâ€™t have to push them to your repo (if you do we wonâ€™t take them into account). We will use our own main.c files at compilation. Our `main.c` files might be different from the one shown in the examples
- The prototypes of all your functions should be included in your header file called `binary_trees.h`
- Donâ€™t forget to push your header file
- All your header files should be include guarded


## More Info
------------
### Data structures

```
/**
 * struct binary_tree_s - Binary tree node
 *
 * @n: Integer stored in the node
 * @parent: Pointer to the parent node
 * @left: Pointer to the left child node
 * @right: Pointer to the right child node
 */
struct binary_tree_s
{
    int n;
    struct binary_tree_s *parent;
    struct binary_tree_s *left;
    struct binary_tree_s *right;
};

typedef struct binary_tree_s binary_tree_t;
```
Binary Search Tree
```
typedef struct binary_tree_s bst_t;
```
AVL Tree
```
typedef struct binary_tree_s avl_t;
```
Max Binary Heap
```
typedef struct binary_tree_s heap_t;
```
Note: For tasks 0 to 23 (included), you have to deal with simple binary trees. They are not BSTs, thus they donâ€™t follow any kind of rule.

## Print function
---

To match the examples in the tasks, you are given [this function](https://github.com/holbertonschool/0x1C.c)

This function is used only for visualization purposes. You donâ€™t have to push it to your repo. It may not be used during the correction.
